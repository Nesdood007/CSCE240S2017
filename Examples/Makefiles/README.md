# Makefile Examples

I have created some Makefile Examples so as to better help you understand how you can use them to your advantage.
There are Makefiles that do the following things:
* Compile C++ code with one source file
* Compile C++ code with multiple .C files and .h files with only functions
* Use Variables to easily change the name of the executable and compiled binaries
* Use Bash commands to automate certain tasks
