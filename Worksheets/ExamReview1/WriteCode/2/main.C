/*  This section will have you write some c++ code to do something
    
    Question #2: Write a program that prints, given some user input 'n', the following pattern
        a. There are n lines total
        b. Every other line starting from the first line has the string "()" n times
        c. Every other line starting from the second has "(" n times followed by ")" n times
        
        Example if n = 4:
            ()()()()
            (((())))
            ()()()()
            (((())))
